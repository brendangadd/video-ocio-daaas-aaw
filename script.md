## 0. Portal

The Advanced Analytics Workspace gives its users the power of end-to-end data
science and analysis, ranging from data exploration to machine learning and
interactive visualization. Built on open standards, AAW enables fast and
frictionless collaboration between team members and research partners.

Sign into our DAaaS portal with one click to discover and access the Advanced
Analytics Workspace tools like Kubeflow, as well as support materials like our
Slack community and Getting Started videos.

## 1. Create Server

All StatCan employees can already activate their AAW account and launch their
first workspace in about three minutes. From there, our users can create
anything from small machines for exploration to monster configurations with
multiple CPUs and specialized hardware for machine learning.

Workspaces are a completely self-serve experience. With self-serve and powerful
compute, our users get to analysis faster, and run experiments at a scale that
was previously unattainable.

## 2. JupyterLab

We offer a choice of flexible environments tailored to a variety of analysis,
including JupyterLab, RStudio, and desktop-style experiences. Choosing
JupyterLab gives an interactive notebook environment for Python, R, and Julia
where analysts can mix code, prose, and interactive visualizations.

Our JupyterLab environment is the first in the industry to support both official
languages. In choosing open tools, we're able to add features our users care
about, like multi-language support, even for products that don't have it out of
the box.

## 3. Desktop

Some great software isn't built for notebooks; it requires a desktop to run. For
these situations, the AAW offers desktop-style workspaces for analysts to run
the applications they know and love.

Our desktops come preloaded with powerful analysis software like QGIS, RStudio,
a spreadsheet app, and even Visual Studio Code.

## 4. RStudio

For our avid R users, we offer the familiar RStudio experience directly in the
browser. Analysts can explore and analyse their data, and use Shiny to create
beautiful and interactive dashboards.

AAW also offers a Shiny server for our users to publish visualizations once
they're done perfecting them in the RStudio environment.

## 5. Kibana

Elastic Search and Kibana let analysts create easy drag-and-drop business
intelligence dashboards to quickly gain insights into huge amounts of
unstructured data.

This prototype SEDAR dashboard uses machine learning to process thousands of
public financial report PDFs, putting their data at analysts' fingertips. With
Elastic and Kibana, analysts can rapidly find the exact information they need.
Answers that used to require reading through dozens of financial documents are
now available in a matter of seconds.

## 6. Pipelines (Bandits)

Kubeflow Pipelines gives users the tools to automate data ingestion tasks, as
well as a way to scale up and track their experiments.

In the _Office Building Reopenings_ project, data scientists leveraged Kubeflow
Experiments to organize, record, and scale their multi-armed bandit simulations
in parallel. They were able to run over 24,000 CPU-hours of computations in just
over a week and provide timely results to the Public Health Agency.

This same analysis performed on a single four-core server would have taken over
eight months to complete.

## 7. Contributors

In data analytics, collaboration is key, and AAW makes it simple for analysts to
work together with the same tools on the same data.

Sharing a workspace with a colleague is as simple as adding their account as a
contributor. They can immediately see the new profile and begin collaborating on
the project.

## 8. Kubecost

We know our users want insights into all types of data, and that includes their
resource usage and financial costs. AAW cost management features provide these
insights in a visual way for easy consumption, and can send notifications when
costs exceed user-defined thresholds.

## 9. Open-Source

We've chosen open source tools that are already standards in the industry â€“
tools which are familiar to users and reduce friction with our partners. And in
turn, we work in the open ourselves. Being a part of an open community is
something we care about, but it also benefits our customer.

With less licence fees, and the option to recreate AAW in their own environment,
our customers enjoy a lower cost and lower risk. And we ensure our freedom to
deliver the features they care about most.

By going open, we can give more for less.

This is our competetive advantage. This is the Advanced Analytics Workspace.
