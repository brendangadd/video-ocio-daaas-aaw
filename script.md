# Advanced Analytics Workspace

## 0. Portal

The Advanced Analytics Workspace, or AAW, gives its users the power of
end-to-end data science and analysis, ranging from data exploration to machine
learning and interactive visualization. Built on open standards, the AAW enables
easy collaboration between users.

They can sign into the DAaaS portal with one click to discover and access the
Advanced Analytics Workspace tools like Kubeflow, as well as support materials
like our Slack community and “Getting Started” videos.

## 1. Create Server

All Statistics Canada employees can already activate their AAW account and
launch their first workspace in about three minutes. From there, they can create
anything from small machines for exploration to monster configurations with
specialized hardware for machine learning.

With AAW's self-serve experience and powerful compute, users get to analysis
faster, and run experiments at a scale that was previously unattainable.

## 2. JupyterLab

The Advances Analytics Workspace offers a choice of environments tailored to a
variety of analysis, including JupyterLab, RStudio, and desktop-style
experiences. Choosing JupyterLab gives an interactive notebook environment for
Python, R, and Julia where analysts can mix code, prose, and interactive
visualizations.

Our JupyterLab environment is the first in the industry to support both official
languages. In choosing open tools, we're able to add these features our users
care about, even for products that don't have them out of the box.

## 3. Desktop

Some great software isn't built for notebooks; it requires a desktop to run. For
these situations, the AAW offers desktop-style workspaces for analysts to use
the applications they know and love, from QGIS to spreadsheets.

## 4. RStudio

For our avid R users, we offer a familiar RStudio experience directly in the
browser. They can explore and analyse their data, and use Shiny to create
beautiful and interactive dashboards.

AAW also offers a Shiny server for our users to publish visualizations once
they're done perfecting them in their RStudio environment.

## 5. Kibana

Elastic Search and Kibana let analysts create easy drag-and-drop business
intelligence dashboards to quickly gain insights into huge amounts of
unstructured data.

This prototype SEDAR dashboard uses AI to process thousands of public financial
report PDFs, putting their data at analysts' fingertips. With Elastic and
Kibana, analysts can rapidly find the exact information they need. Answers that
used to require reading through dozens of financial documents are now available
in a matter of seconds.

## 6. Pipelines (Bandits)

Kubeflow Pipelines gives users the tools to automate data ingestion tasks, as
well as a way to scale up and track their experiments.

In the _Office Building Reopenings_ project, data scientists leveraged Kubeflow
Experiments to organize, record, and scale their multi-armed bandit simulations
in parallel. They were able to run over 24,000 CPU-hours of computations in just
over a week and provide timely results to the Public Health Agency.

This same analysis performed on a single four-core server would have taken over
eight months to complete.

## 8. Kubecost

We know our users want insights into all types of data, and that includes their
resource usage and financial costs. AAW cost management features provide these
insights in a visual way for easy consumption, and can send notifications when
costs exceed user-defined thresholds.

## 9. Open-Source

We've chosen open source tools that are already standards in the industry. And
in turn, we work in the open ourselves. Being a part of an open community is
something we care about, but it also benefits our customer.

With less licence fees, and the option to recreate AAW in their own environment,
our users enjoy a lower cost and lower risk. And we ensure our freedom to
deliver the features they care about most.

By going open, we can give more for less. This is our competitive advantage.
This is the Advanced Analytics Workspace.
